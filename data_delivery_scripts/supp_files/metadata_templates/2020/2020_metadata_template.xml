      <abstract>TreeMap 2020 CONUS provides a tree-level model of the forests of the conterminous United States. Throughout the conterminous United States (CONUS), for each forested pixel in 30x30 meter (m) gridded landscape data for circa 2020, we identified and assigned the most similar Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot. We used a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm to impute the forest plot data to a set of target rasters provided by Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) and Daymet (Daymet). Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, vegetation height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), climatic variables (precipitation, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, vapor pressure, and vapor pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type).
      
      The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30×30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S., corresponding to landscape conditions circa 2020. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart to map hundreds of attributes available there, or to the comma separated file included in this data publication to access a more limited set of tree-level attributes. The data files included in this publication also contain attributes for each tree in the plots that were assigned, including the FIA plot CN for the plot on which the tree was measured (or control number, a unique identifier for each time a plot is measured), the subplot number, the tree record number, the corresponding number of trees per acre it represents due to the study design, the status (live or dead), species, diameter, height, actual height (where broken), crown ratio and a code for cause of death where applicable. Previous versions of TreeMap have been validated for characteristics including percent live tree cover, height of the dominant trees, forest type, species of trees with most basal area, and snag hazard category. Previous versions of TreeMap are being used in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel treatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial carbon resources. 
      
      This GeoTIFF is a subset of the main TreeMap2020_CONUS dataset, in which a single attribute, {col_name}, has been written to the raster band.</abstract>

      <purpose>Geospatial data describing tree species or forest structure are required for many analyses and models of forest landscape dynamics. Forest data must have resolution and continuity sufficient to reflect site gradients in mountainous terrain and stand boundaries imposed by historical events, such as wildland fire and timber harvest. The TreeMap 2014 dataset (Riley et al. 2019) was the first of its kind to provide such detailed forest structure data across the forests of the conterminous United States. Prior to the TreeMap 2014 imputed forest data, assessments relied largely on forest inventory at fixed plot locations at sparse densities. The TreeMap 2016 dataset (Riley et al. 2021, Riley et al. 2022) updated the 2014 version to include disturbance as a response variable, which improved accuracy in disturbed areas. The TreeMap 2020 CONUS dataset featured here updates the TreeMap 2016 dataset to landscape conditions circa 2020 and updates the methods by 1) using a different suite of  climate variables in the imputation and 2) improving species composition assignments to prevent plots being imputed to areas where their existing vegetation type was not present, an issue which affected a small number of pixels in previous TreeMap versions. See the Process Step section for more details on methodology.</purpose>

      <attraccr>We used the imputed inventory data to generate maps of forest cover, forest height, vegetation group, and disturbance code at 30×30 m resolution for all forested pixels in the conterminous United States, as a means of assessing the accuracy of our methodology. The results showed good correspondence between the target LANDFIRE data and the imputed plot data, with an overall within-class agreement of 94.3% for forest cover, 99.0% for forest height, 95.6% for vegetation group, and 95.5% for disturbance code.

      The methods were the same as those described in Riley et al. (2022) except that 1) the climatic variables were calculated as 30-year normals (1981-2010) from Daymet and downscaled to 30×30m resolution from 1×1km resolution; Daymet variables included precipitation, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, vapor pressure, and vapor pressure deficit (which was derived from other Daymet variables); and 2) we addressed the “ride-along problem” of imputing plots in a small proportion of pixels with geographically-inconsistent vegetation types. The plots available for imputation in each LANDFIRE zone were limited to those plots containing species that were present either in that LANDFIRE zone or in the zones immediately bordering it, according to the FIA plots located within the zone. This reduced not only plots with the wrong existing vegetation type but also plots with trees outside of their observed range.

      Of 69,800 single-condition FIA plots available to Random Forest, 64,745 of these (92.7%) were utilized in the imputation to 2,687,805,994 forested pixels.</attraccr>

    <complete>Forest plots available for imputation were those that met the following criteria: 1) physically located in the conterminous United States, 2) single-condition, 100% forested FIA Phase 2 plots. There were 69,800 plots that met these criteria and were available for imputation; of these, 64,745 (92.7%) were chosen for imputation at least once.

        <srccontr>We obtained measurements of tree diameter at breast height, height, species, and status (dead or alive) as well as plot elevation, aspect, and slope from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). Version 1.9.1 data was downloaded from the FIA DataMart. We restricted the plot data to single-condition forested plots only; conditions are defined by changes in vegetation or land use, and some plots have more than one condition because of harvesting, fire, or land ownership boundaries. Because we wanted the plots used in the imputation to be more or less homogeneous, we used single-condition plots only. Plot locations in the FIA DataMart are fuzzed to protect plot integrity and true coordinates are not available to the public; for the purposes of this study, we obtained true locations from FIA via a Memorandum of Cooperation. The most recent version of the FIADB (version 1.9.1) was used to calculate the attributes in the attribute table of the TreeMap 2020 CONUS raster (TreeMap2020_CONUS.tif).</srccontr>

        <srccontr>Daymet provides long-term, continuous, gridded estimates of daily weather and climatology variables by interpolating and extrapolating ground-based observations through statistical modeling techniques (Thornton et al. 2022). Daymet weather variables include daily minimum and maximum temperature (tmin, tmax), precipitation (prcp), vapor pressure (vp), shortwave radiation (srad), and snow water equivalent (swe) produced on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface over North America from 1980 through the end of the most recent full calendar year.</srccontr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A suite of rasters mapping vegetation and disturbance for the landscape circa 2020 were obtained from the LANDFIRE project’s website (https://www.landfire.gov/data/FullExtentDownloads). Rasters mapping climatic variables (tmin, tmax, vp, prcp, swe, srad) were obtained from Daymet (https://daymet.ornl.gov/). We calculated 30-year normals (1981-2010) for each of these variables and used those means as inputs to the imputation model. We calculated vapor pressure deficit (VPD) from the climate data following methods in Lobell et al. (2014).

        We downloaded 30 years of data (1981-2010) from Daymet and calculated the annual average for our climate variables of interest, then downscaled the climate data from 1km×1km resolution. The final target rasters (or predictor rasters to which the FIA plots were assigned) included: slope, aspect, elevation, Existing Vegetation Cover, Existing Vegetation Height, Existing Vegetation Type, disturbance (i.e. fire or insects and disease), average precipitation, average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, average vapor pressure, average soil water equivalent, average vapor pressure deficit, average shortwave radiation. We used these rasters as target data for the Random Forest model (see Riley et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2022) for more details on methodology).

        Tabular information regarding FIA plots was obtained from the FIA DataMart. True plot locations are not available in the DataMart and were obtained directly from FIA via a Memorandum of Cooperation. We obtained information directly from the FIA DataMart regarding plot elevation, slope, and aspect, as well as tree-level information for each plot (i.e. number of trees per acre, height, diameter at breast height, species, and status (live or dead)). In a small subset of plots, slope and/or aspect were not recorded within the FIA database. These plots were assigned slope and aspect by intersecting the FIA plot location with the LANDFIRE 2020 slope and aspect raster datasets. We calculated plot-level tree cover and height using the StrClass keyword in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (Dixon 2002, Crookston and Stage 1999). Existing Vegetation Type was assigned to each plot using a series of scripts we obtained from LANDFIRE; these scripts are not publicly available and were obtained via a Memorandum of Cooperation. We assigned climatic predictors to each plot via spatial overlay of the plot locations with the Daymet rasters in R. This plot-level information was used as reference data in the Random Forest model.

        We then used a modified Random Forest approach with the vegetation, disturbance, and biophysical predictors as the target data, to which we imputed the FIA plot data at 30-meter (m) grid resolution (Riley et al. (2016), Riley et al. (2021), and Riley et al. (2022)). This method imputed the plot with the best statistical match, according to a “forest” of decision trees, to each pixel of gridded landscape data.
         
        {col_name} was then separated into its own raster by writing values in the raster attribute table to the corresponding pixels in the raster band.

        For complete details see Riley et al. (2016), Riley et al. (2021), and Riley et al. (2022). Methods for the TreeMap 2020 version differ from those in Riley et al. (2022) in that 1) the climatic variables were obtained from Daymet and included precipitation, shortwave radiation, soil water equivalent, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, vapor pressure, and vapor pressure deficit; and 2) plots available for imputation in each LANDFIRE zone were limited to those plots with a tree species that were present either in the plots found within the LANDFIRE zone, or in the zones immediately bordering it, according to the FIA plots located within the zone. This reduced not only plots with Existing Vegetation Type not present in the zone but also plots with trees outside of their observed range.

      IMPORTANT INFORMATION

      TreeMap2020_CONUS_{col_name}.tif is a subset of the full TreeMap2020_CONUS dataset. Band values for TreeMap2020_CONUS_{col_name}.tif are those found in the attribute table of the full dataset.

	  	  
      DATA FILE DESCRIPTIONS (1)
      
      (1) TreeMap2020_CONUS_{col_name}.tif:
       Raster dataset (GeoTIFF file) representing a single attribute, {col_name}, of the full model output generated by Random Forest imputation of forest inventory plot data measured by Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) to unsampled (and sampled) spatial locations on the landscape for circa 2020 conditions. {col_name} is a measure of {col_description} of the FIA plot CN assigned to each pixel. Predictor variables in the Random Forest imputation were chosen to optimize the prediction of aboveground forest carbon. These include topographic variables (slope, aspect, and elevation from the FIA PLOT and COND tables), true plot location, vegetation (forest cover, height, and vegetation group assigned to each plot via Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS, https://www.fs.fed.us/fvs/, Dixon 2002) and LANDFIRE methods), disturbance (years since disturbance and disturbance type as derived from LANDFIRE disturbance rasters), and climatic variables (maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil water equivalent, vapor pressure, and and vapor pressure deficit deficit derived by overlay of the plot coordinates with Daymet 30-year normals). Variables and methods for the full model output are defined in more completeness in Riley et al. (2022), Riley et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2016), the accompanying Data Dictionary file, and the FIA documentation (Burrill et al. 2024).
